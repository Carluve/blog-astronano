## Overview

TimerCF is a web-based countdown timer deployed on Cloudflare Workers. The application features a three-step setup flow, bilingual support (Spanish/English), and a standby screen when the countdown completes.

## Why This Solution Works

TimerCF addresses the need for quick event countdown deployment without complex infrastructure: you need a clear countdown screen for an event, and you need it fast. Rather than building separate backend and frontend systems, the Worker delivers the entire experience from a single entry point.

**The user flow consists of four steps:**

1. Enter event name
2. Choose timer mode
3. Select preset or custom duration
4. Start countdown

A key UX detail: when the timer ends, the interface transitions to a red standby state displaying the final message, avoiding jarring transitions during live presentations.

## Technical Implementation

Built in TypeScript, TimerCF uses a Worker entry point that returns HTML, CSS, and JavaScript inline within a single response. `wrangler` handles development and deployment.

**Architectural advantages:**

- Single runtime platform (Cloudflare Workers)
- One deployment target
- No separate API service required
- Fast global content delivery

Additional features include manual language switching, automatic browser language detection, and persistent theme preferences via localStorage.

## Trade-offs to Consider

The single-file inline approach has limitations:

- Maintainability challenges as the interface grows without careful organization
- No persistent backend state limits advanced event management features
- Future needs like analytics, user accounts, or multi-event dashboards would require architectural changes

These constraints are acceptable for the tool's narrow purpose: run a reliable event timer with minimal friction.

## Key Insight

Many small event tools fail because they are over-engineered too early. TimerCF prioritizes timing clarity and operator workflow over feature breadth, enabling rapid deployment without operational complexity.

## Future Considerations

Potential enhancements include event-type-specific presets and lightweight usage observability, though the current form is already a production-ready pattern for focused event experiences.
